## üìñ Description

The **Hospital Management System** is a C++ application designed to coordinate patient care, staffing, billing, and transfers across multiple hospital locations. By leveraging **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts, it provides a clear structure to manage a network of hospitals, doctors, nurses, and patients. Our system supports up to five hospitals, 50 doctors, 60 nurses, and 100 patients overall, with core functionalities including:

- Patient admission, discharge, and transfer.
- Doctor and nurse assignments with capacity constraints.
- Basic billing system based on daily rates.
- Extendable design for future integration with databases, GUIs, or pharmacies.

## Project Overview

This **Hospital Management System** focuses on:
- Managing **Patients** (admission, discharge, transfer, billing).
- Managing **Staff** (Doctors, Nurses) across multiple hospital locations.
- Demonstrating OOP principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Composition).
- Providing a foundation for further **innovations** like database integration, UI/UX, or more sophisticated reporting modules.

**Why we built this**:  
> Hospital management involves complex workflows and large volumes of data. We wanted to simulate real-world constraints (limited beds, staff capacity, multiple locations) while maintaining a clear object-oriented design.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Multi-Hospital Network**  
  Each hospital can admit up to 20 patients, allowing for a combined capacity of 100 across five locations.

- **Doctors & Nurses**  
  - Up to 50 doctors with unique IDs and specialties.  
  - Up to 60 nurses, each caring for a maximum of two patients.

- **Patient Management**  
  - Unique Patient IDs, personal details, disease information, and contact details.  
  - Automatic assignment of a primary doctor (plus additional doctors if needed).  
  - Transfer between hospitals without data loss.

- **Billing System**  
  - Basic daily-rate calculation; can be extended for complex billing rules.  
  - Integrated in each hospital to generate invoices.

- **Extendable Architecture**  
  - Optional `Pharmacy` module for prescription management and pharmacy billing.  
  - Room for additional features like real-time reporting, analytics, and user interfaces.
